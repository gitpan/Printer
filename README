DESCRIPTION
    A low-level cross-platform interface to system printers.

    This module is intended to allow perl programs to use and query printers
    on any computer system capable of running perl. The intention of this
    module is for a program to be able to use the printer without having to
    know which operating system is being used.

PLATFORMS
    This code has been tested on Linux, windows 95 and windows NT4.
